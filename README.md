an example to learn how to use Github

now is 2018\5\9 14:33. I have sighed up a Github for about two years,but this is my first time to learn how to use Github to management my code.

now is  2020\03\26 9:18. It is time for me to learn how to use github.
Today, I create a branch named other_branch_0326.
I will create a new file in this branch, upload a .ipynb file.
